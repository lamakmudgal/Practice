Problem:
Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.
For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".
Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").
Note:
The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.

Discussion: For B to be a substring of multiple of A it palindrom of A should exist in B.


Default cases:
 length of B should be greater than A
